# Backpropagation Implementation Through Logistic Regression and FCNN

This repo contains implementations for both logistic regression and FCNN APIs that I did to learn how backpropagation works.

The API for the FCNN is pretty neat, and I will probably (ðŸ¤ž) continue developing it in its own package along with other neural networks implementations for learning purposes. The work on this will probably go [here](https://github.com/obadakhalili/pico-nn/tree/main).
